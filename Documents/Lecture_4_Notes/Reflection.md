# ðŸ§  Reflection â€“ Lecture 4

## What I Learned
- Recursion is powerful for solving problems that have repeated structure.
- The base case is essential â€” otherwise, the program keeps calling itself forever.
- Decomposing tasks into smaller functions makes my code easier to follow.

## What Was Challenging
- Understanding the recursion flow at first (especially Fibonacci).
- Tracing how values return back up the call stack.

## What Clicked
- Drawing recursive call trees helped me visualize how each call returns.
- Coding and testing small examples (like reverse string) helped me get confident.

## Next Steps
- Complete Problem Set 1 (Part A)
- Start practicing recursive problems on LeetCode or HackerRank
